## Glossary
__Clients__ - a client is a person that is under the care and supervision of a clinician. A client that is at risk of self-harm or harming others could be considered ‘High Risk’. A client can be as young as 5 years old. A client has either an Android or an Apple smartphone.
__Clinicians__ - a doctor is a person that is in direct contact with and responsable for 1 or more clients. A clinician has a desktop computer and a smartphone.
__Safety Plan__ - a safety plan is a list of steps that is used by clinicians to help clients. A safety plan consists of triggers, warning signs, destructive behaviors, internal coping strategies, external coping strategies, and a list of professionals.

## Current System
The current system involves printing the safety plan for clients on paper and then handing that plan to the clients. If the client is on the phone or over Zoom, then the safety plan is printed and mailed to the client. This is not ideal because it can be easily lost, destroyed, or not easily accessible to the client. In addition, the paper plan is not interactive and thus may not be as helpful as it could.

## Goals
The main goal of this project is to streamline the process of accessing and editing the safety plan using the clinician’s desktop/phone and the client’s phone. This is accomplished by the following:

- Safe and secure storage of safety plans uploaded by the clinician.
- The application should ask for access to the contact list to get a friend's phone number for calls
- The users should be presented with choices to create or modify safety plans, and see when a plan was edited and by who.
- The application should have search bar for the users to search for client’s safety plans
- The app should allow both clinician and client to enter and delete items since clients may have trouble typing during phone calls.
- Add resources that the clients can access in the app (help lines, on call clinician)
- Signing up. logging in, and logging out
- The clinician should be able to add a client

## Stakeholders
Clinicians - They want to view a list of their patients records and their safety plans. They would also like an easier way to communicate the plan with their clients. Lastly, they would like the app to automatically ask the client if they would like to give the app access to their contact list in case of an emergency (currently, the clinicians have to ask the client for a list and must add it themselves). 

Clients - They want to have quick access to their safety plans and to their emergency contacts in times of distress. They also want their plans to be more interactive than just a piece of paper.

Family of Clients - They should have quick access to the safety plans at any point of time.

Funding agency that monitors clinicians - They want to see if the CFC’s app helps improve the interaction between clinicians and and their clients, and ultimately help improve the lives of the clients. 

Administrators within CFC - They have to keep track of the clinician's activity and the services provided to clients.

IT Support within CFC - They have to support any computer-based activities.

## Scope
The scope of this project is to make an application that can create, read, update and delete clients/clinicians user accounts and safety plans for clients.

## Input

#### Clients:

- The input would be a user’s (clinician or client) username and password to access the system and choose the preferred language in the same screen.
- The knowledge to create a safety plan. There would be about 5 or 6 steps to create a safety plan and in each of these steps, the user will be presented with few options to choose from. 
- The knowledge to be able to add profile information like name, address, e.t.c. The users should be able to add emergency contact information to request for help. 

####  Clinicians:

- The input would be a user’s (clinician or client) username and password to access the system and choose the preferred language in the same screen.
- The input would be a user's knowledge of the client and the client's needs, as well as the expertise about the kinds of situations that clients in general face.

## Processing

- Each selected warning sign should search for and display the appropriate internal and external coping strategies. 
- Clinicians searches should search for multiple patients’ records and safety plans. 
- They should be able to access any patient’s record easily without any blockers. 
- When clients want to view their safety plan, it should be displayed very quickly without mmuch load time, or complicated retrieval procedure. 
- Clients should be able to quickly redirect to emergency steps 4, 5, and 6. 
- Clients can edit their safety plan, and their clinician should be notified and see the changes that were made. 
- When clients want to notify their emergency contacts via text or phone, the text should be prewritten.
- The current users should be able to edit the safety plan and their profile information. 
- The user should be able to search for a client’s record using the search bar
- The user should be able to edit the safety plan

- There should be a login screen where the user can enter their ID, password and change the language if they want to. 
- After the user signs in successfully, the user is navigated to the home screen. From the main home screen, the user can navigate to their safety plan or the profile section or the emergency contacts section.
- In the safety plan section, user should be able to view, modify or delete the safety plan
- In the profile section, the user should be able to change their profile information
- In the emergency contacts section, the user should be presented with choices to contact their emergency contacts by text or call.
- There should be a login screen where the user can enter their ID, password and change the language if they want to. 
- After the user signs in successfully, the user should be navigated to a screen where they can search for a client’s record. The user should also be able to view or modify the safety plan of a client.

## Output

#### Clients:

The safety plan

#### Clinicians:

Safety plans and lists of all clients

## Data Sources

The data source is whatever the client or clinician gives to us, however a data source may be added at a later time. We will add mock data to demonstrate the system.
